# VectorCodeLens MCP Inspector Report

## Summary of Findings

After attempting to run MCP Inspector on the VectorCodeLens project, we've identified several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   - The VectorCodeLens server requires two external services:
     - LLM Service on port 8020
     - Qdrant Vector Database on port 6333
   - Our tests indicate these services are not running, which prevents VectorCodeLens from starting properly

2. **Node.js Environment Issues**
   - Node.js installation needs to be properly configured in the system PATH
   - This causes issues with running npm and npx commands needed for the MCP Inspector

3. **MCP Inspector Access**
   - The MCP Inspector (`@modelcontextprotocol/inspector`) couldn't be installed due to Node.js configuration issues
   - Without the inspector, it's difficult to diagnose MCP-specific issues

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Fix Node.js Environment

First, ensure Node.js is properly installed and accessible in the PATH:

```bash
# Verify Node.js is working
node --version
npm --version

# If Node.js is not in PATH, add it to your system PATH environment variable
```

For a permanent fix, modify the system PATH to include Node.js.

### 2. Start Required External Services

Ensure both required services are running:

#### LLM Service
The VectorCodeLens requires an LLM service accessible at http://localhost:8020.
This service should provide:
- A text generation endpoint (default route)
- An embeddings endpoint (/embeddings)

Options:
- Use a local LLM server
- Configure an external service
- Use our mock_services.js script to create a temporary mock

#### Qdrant Vector Database
The vector database should be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:6333.

Options:
- Install Qdrant locally: [Qdrant Installation Guide](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/installation/)
- Use Docker: `docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant`
- Use our mock_services.js script for testing

### 3. Run Dependency Checks

After setting up the dependencies, run the dependency check:

```bash
node check-dependencies.js
```

This will verify both services are accessible before starting VectorCodeLens.

### 4. Use MCP Inspector

Once the environment is properly configured, you can use the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
```

This will provide a web interface for testing and debugging the MCP server.

## Diagnostic Tools Created

We've created several diagnostic tools to help:

1. **mock_services.js** - Creates mock versions of the LLM and Qdrant services
2. **check_ports.js** - Checks if the required ports are in use
3. **test_import.js** - Tests importing the VectorCodeLens modules
4. **diagnose.js** - Comprehensive diagnostic script

## Next Steps

1. Fix the Node.js environment issues
2. Start the required external services
3. Verify connectivity with the check_ports.js script
4. Run VectorCodeLens with the check-dependencies.js script
5. Use MCP Inspector to test and debug the server's functionality

If issues persist, check the logs for specific error messages.
