  VectorCodeLens is a sophisticated semantic codebase analysis platform that leverages vector embeddings and Large
  Language Models (LLMs) to provide intelligent code understanding and natural language querying capabilities.

  Application Summary

  This is an AI-powered code analysis tool that transforms traditional static code analysis by adding semantic
  understanding. It scans codebases, breaks them into intelligent chunks, analyzes them using LLMs, converts them
  to vector embeddings, and stores them in a vector database for semantic search. Users can then query their
  codebase using natural language questions like "How are errors handled?" or "Show me authentication patterns."

  The system implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI model integration and follows a progressive
  enhancement strategy - it works with minimal dependencies but becomes more powerful as additional services are
  available.

  Core Features

  - Semantic Code Understanding: Goes beyond syntax to understand code intent and patterns
  - Natural Language Querying: Ask questions about codebases in plain English
  - Progressive Enhancement: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
  - Vector-Based Search: Uses embeddings for similarity-based code discovery
  - Multi-LLM Support: Works with both local (Ollama) and cloud (Claude) LLMs
  - Intelligent Chunking: Structure-aware code segmentation
  - MCP Integration: Standard protocol for AI model communication
